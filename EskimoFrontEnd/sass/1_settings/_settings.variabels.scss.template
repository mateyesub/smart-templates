//This holds any global variabel for your project. 
//I'd like to stress the word global â€“ this layer 
//should only house variabels that need to be accessed 
//from anywhere.
//This ensures this layer stays nice and slim, and 
//means that most settings can be found alongside the 
//code that uses them, making finding things far simpler.
//Any variable that is not be accessed globaly should 
//belong to the layer to which it relates.
